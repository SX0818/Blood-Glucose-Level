# Blood-Glucose-Level (UBC STAT 344)

The dataset utilized for this project was sourced from Kaggle, a reputable online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Specifically, we utilized the "Stroke Prediction Dataset" curated by Fedesoriano, which includes a comprehensive collection of health-related information on a diverse sample of individuals.

To ensure the validity and reliability of our findings, we employed two widely recognized sampling techniques: simple random sampling (SRS) and stratified sampling (STR). These approaches allowed us to effectively predict and analyze the blood glucose levels of the general population, while minimizing biases and errors that may arise from inadequate sampling procedures.

Overall, this project adheres to the rigorous academic standards required for reliable and accurate research, and we believe that our findings provide valuable insights into the health outcomes and risk factors associated with blood glucose levels in the general population.
